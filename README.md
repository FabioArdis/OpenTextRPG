Welcome, and thanks for choosing Open Text RPG.  
This is a work-in-progress game, that means that it is actually playable, but due to its early life, it can suffer from bugs and other problems. Found a bug or have any ideas? Please, create an Issue. Do you want to collaborate or simply fix a bug? Feel free to make a new Pull Request.

# To-do list:
I've set up a [Projects](https://github.com/FabioArdis/OpenTextRPG/projects) page, go check it up!

# How to compile
In the 45th commit I added a Makefile. Just install GCC-G++ and write in your terminal 
```bash
make
```
 or 
 ```bash
 make all
 ```
  to compile Open Text RPG. A file called "OTRPG" should now appear in the folder you ran make.
